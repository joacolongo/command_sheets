LABELING

label name CA, resn + resi                     --> Label residues with 3-letter code and number

label sele, "%s%s" % (resn, resi)              --> Custom label format for selection

MEASUREMENTS

distance hb, (resi 45), (resi 78)              --> Measure distance between residues 45 and 78
angle ang, (name CA and resi 45), (name CA and resi 46), (name CA and resi 47)  --> Measure angle
dihedral dih, (name N and resi 1), (name CA and resi 1), (name C and resi 1), (name N and resi 2) --> Measure dihedral angle
get_area sele, load_b=1                        --> Compute SASA and store in B-factor

TRANSFORMATIONS

distance hb, (resi 45), (resi 78)              --> Measure distance between residues 45 and 78
angle ang, (name CA and resi 45), (name CA and resi 46), (name CA and resi 47)  --> Measure angle
dihedral dih, (name N and resi 1), (name CA and resi 1), (name C and resi 1), (name N and resi 2) --> Measure dihedral angle
get_area sele, load_b=1                        --> Compute SASA and store in B-factor


CONTACTS

h_add sele                                     --> Add hydrogens to selection
find_pairs sele1, sele2                        --> Find interaction pairs between two selections
dist hbonds, resn STI, not resn STI, mode=2    --> Hydrogen bonds between ligand STI and the rest


GROUPING

create resist, resi 250+253+256+301+315+317+320+351+373+381   --> Create object from residues
